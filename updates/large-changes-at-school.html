		<p class="paratext">
		This section will only cover a portion of what is on <a href="" target="_blank">this list</a>. If you would like to know more, please read it.
		<br></br>
		Cypress is doing something called "Easing-in at the Bay." This plan is "focused on school-wide and classroom initiatives to narrow academic gaps and improve instruction and learning potential." Staff plan to focus on every student's social and emotional needs during this next school year. They didn't specify how but we can probably expect more mental health lectures judging by last year. 
		<br></br>
		Cypress is "reimaging" the structure of how students utilize their <b>Study Hall time by emphasizing a commitment to 45 MINUTES of academic focus</b>. The remaining 45 minutes <b>CAN</b> be dedicated to mental rejuvenation and unwinding for the remainder of Study Hall period. This new "rule" is called the <b>45/45 Study Hall Rule</b>.
		<br></br>
		From a student perspective, I do not believe that this rule would be a strict one. I think that the rule would have different affects on your study hall depending on the teacher. I don't see this as a major problem since Cypress used the word "can" for the remainding 45 minutes.
		<br></br>
		Cypress has now implemented a dedicated <b>HOMEROOM</b>. Students will now have time built into their second and sixth periods to participate in "Social Emotional Learning activities." These periods will help students receive announcements in one place. These announcements will be broadcasted to everyone without interrupting instructional time.
		<br></br>
		Cypress has done some "research" and it indicates that "schools in which homework is routinely assigned and assessed tend to have higher achieving students" (No source on this research btw.) Broward County staff believes that homework fosters student achievement, independence, and responsibility. Therefore, Broward County is making it required to include "meaningful and quality homework" at all grade levels in all schools.
		<br></br>
		Sadly, Cypress has emphasized what "meaningful and quality homework" means. This type of homework is defined as "work assigned to students that are intended to be completed during non-instructional hours." Cypress says that homework will vary based on course level (non-honors, honors, AP, or AICE). 
		<br></br>
		Cypress will now start offering "training" to students who wish to go. They will be on your study hall time if you choose to go. Trainings include using a planner, study skills, note taking, time management, stress management, self-advocacy, and canvas.
